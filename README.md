# Ignis Parser
A small personal tool to parse output files from [Ignis](https://github.com/thane98/ignis), a randomizer tool for Fire Emblem Fates.

This was originally written to keep track of child units and inheritance classes in randomized runs, with other miscellaneous features being added over time.
