# Ignis Parser
A small personal tool to parse output files from Ignis, a randomizer tool for Fire Emblem Fates.

This was originally written to keep track of child units and inheritance classes in randomized runs, with other miscellaneous features being added over time.

### A Warning
The base version of Ignis, located [here](https://github.com/thane98/ignis), does not distinguish between the two versions of Kana in its output log. That means that this tool cannot reliably find information related to these units. The fork of Ignis located [here](https://github.com/ivy-bridges/ignis) does distinguish between the two, and has an identical build process.
